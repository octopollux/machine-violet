# Module Map

The codebase is split across four packages:

- **`packages/engine/`** — Game engine, AI agents, tools, state, prompts, Fastify server
- **`packages/client-ink/`** — Ink TUI, themes, modals, formatting, phases, Discord IPC
- **`packages/shared/`** — Shared types and protocol schemas
- **`packages/test-harness/`** — Tier-3 live harness + interactive driver (`mvplay`) + full-stack tape recorder. The deterministic Tier-2 backbone lives in `engine` (golden tapes). See [e2e-harness.md](e2e-harness.md) and [golden-tapes.md](golden-tapes.md).

Most directories have `index.ts` barrel exports — check those before reaching into subdirectories. Paths below are relative to their package root (e.g. `agents/game-engine.ts` = `packages/engine/src/agents/game-engine.ts`).

Two root-level dev companion tools live outside the package tree under `tools/`:

- **`tools/campaign-explorer/`** — Express API + React client for browsing campaign state and engine logs.
- **`tools/theme-editor/`** — Theme tinkering UI; `tools/theme-editor/scripts/validate.mjs` parses every theme and resolves every variant (run after editing a `.theme` asset).

## Engine: agents/ — Orchestration

The game loop, state management, and AI session handling.

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `game-state.ts` | `GameState` interface — the single mutable state object |
| `game-engine.ts` | Main orchestrator: callbacks, turn management, scene transitions |
| `deferred-work.ts` | `DeferredWork` registry — detached background lanes (scribe, scene-tracker) flushed at consistency barriers via `settle()`; blocked settles emit `barrier_wait` spans |
| `agent-loop.ts` | Single-turn conversation loop: streaming, tool handling, usage |
| `tool-registry.ts` | All tool definitions + `TOOL_STATE_MAP` + dispatch |
| `scene-manager.ts` | `SceneState`, transitions, pending operations, precis updates |

| `setup-agent.ts` | Campaign initialization wizard (delegates to setup-conversation subagent) |
| `world-builder.ts` | Campaign scaffolding, entity creation helpers |
| `player-manager.ts` | Turn switching, active player tracking |
| `subagent.ts` | `spawnSubagent()`, `oneShot()` — subagent spawning infrastructure |
| `injections.ts` | `InjectionRegistry` + per-turn `Injection`s (`BehaviorInjection`, `ScenePacingInjection`, `LengthSteeringInjection`, `HardStatsInjection`) — synthetic per-turn DM context steering |
| `name-inspiration.ts` | `buildNameInspiration()` — entropy injection seeding NPC/place name variety |

### Engine: agents/subagents/ — Specialized agents

Each file is an isolated Claude conversation for a specific task. All use `spawnSubagent()` or `oneShot()` from `subagent.ts`.

| `setup-conversation.ts` | Sonnet | Interactive campaign setup wizard |
| `dev-mode.ts` | Sonnet | Developer console (state inspection, file I/O, mutation) |

## Engine: tools/ — Game Mechanics

Stateless game rule engines. Each subdirectory is a domain. Tool handlers take `(state, input)` and return `ToolResult`.

| Directory | Key exports |
|---|---|
| `dice/` | `rollDice()`, `parseExpression()`, `evaluate()`, `seededRng()`, `cryptoRng` |
| `cards/` | `deck()` (create/shuffle/draw/peek/return), `createStandard52()`, `createTarot()` |

| `validation/` | `validateCampaign()` |

## Engine: context/ — Context Window Management

Token tracking, conversation window, prompt caching, state persistence.

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `conversation.ts` | `ConversationManager` — exchange tracking, retention enforcement, tool result stubbing |

| `trace.ts` | Span trace at `../.debug/trace.jsonl` — a causal tree of `turn → agent → api_call/tool` spans (AsyncLocalStorage `withSpan`), correlated by `parentId`/`turnId`. Backs the campaign-explorer Timeline flame chart |

## Engine: providers/ — LLM Provider Adapters

Abstract provider layer: normalizes Anthropic, OpenAI (API key), OpenAI ChatGPT (Codex), OpenRouter, and custom Chat-Completions endpoints behind a single `LLMProvider` interface. All model calls in the engine go through this layer.

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `index.ts` | `createProviderFromConnection()` — factory that constructs the right provider from a stored `AIConnection` record |
| `types.ts` | `LLMProvider` and `TierProvider` interfaces, `ChatParams`, `GenerateImageRequest`/`GenerateImageResult`, `ImageEffort` (`draft`/`standard`/`quality`/`showcase`), `ImageAspect` (`portrait`/`landscape`/`square`) |
| `anthropic.ts` | `createAnthropicProvider()` — Anthropic SDK adapter; streaming, tool use, prompt caching, thinking blocks, rate-limit usage tracking (`anthropic-ratelimit-*` response headers → `getUsageStatus()`) |
| `openai.ts` | `createOpenAIProvider()` — `openai-apikey` / `openrouter` / `custom` adapter; Responses API vs Chat Completions routing, streaming, tool use, image generation — see [openai-provider.md](openai-provider.md) |
| `agent-loop-bridge.ts` | `runProviderLoop()` — provider-agnostic version of the agent turn loop: concurrent tool dispatch, TUI broadcast, deferred-sentinel logic, `cacheHints` for tool-definition cache_control. Returns normalized (not Anthropic-specific) types |
| `orphan-patch.ts` | Heals conversation history with orphaned `tool_use` blocks by inserting deterministic synthetic `tool_result` stubs before replay 400s — see [error-recovery.md](error-recovery.md) |
| `image-coerce.ts` | `normalizeImageEffort()` / `normalizeImageAspect()` — defensive coercion of the model's `generate_image` tool args into valid `ImageEffort` / `ImageAspect` values |
| `openai-chatgpt/` | Codex app-server integration (OAuth, subprocess lifecycle, internal tool dispatch, usage tracking) — see [openai-chatgpt-provider.md](openai-chatgpt-provider.md) |

## Client: agent-sidecar.ts — Dev-only Agent API

Dev-only HTTP server for AI agent integration testing (`--agent-port` or `MV_AGENT_PORT`). Embeds in the TUI client, provides screen capture via `@xterm/headless`, state inspection, and keystroke injection. Endpoints: `GET /screen` (plain text or `?ansi=true`), `GET /state` (JSON), `POST /input` (raw bytes), `POST /input/key` (named key via KEY_MAP). Excluded from release builds.

## Client: tui/ — Terminal UI

Ink (React for CLI) components, formatting pipeline, theme system.

| Directory/File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `layout.tsx` | Main game layout (modeline + narrative + input) |

| `frames/` | Box drawing, styled content lines, string measurement |
| `hooks/` | `useTextInput()`, `useScrollHandle()`, `useMouseScroll()`, `kittyProtocol.ts` (Kitty keyboard protocol detection, CSI-u parsing, legacy re-emission), `stdinFilterChain.ts` (managed stdin filter pipeline for Kitty + mouse scroll interception) |

## Engine: config/ — Configuration

Model selection, campaign init, DM personalities, campaign seeds.

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `models.ts` | `getModel("large" \| "medium" \| "small")` — tier model selection (cached; tests need `loadModelConfig({ reset: true })`) |
| `connections.ts` | Multi-provider connection management: load/save/add/remove connections, tier assignments. Supports Anthropic, OpenAI, OpenRouter, custom providers. Persists to `connections.json` |
| `discord.ts` | Discord integration settings: enabled/disabled state persisted to `discord-settings.json` (on by default) |
| `model-registry.ts` | Dynamic model registry: shipped `known-models.json` merged with user `model-overrides.json`. Pricing, capabilities, context windows, tier defaults per provider |
| `personality-loader.ts` | `loadAllPersonalities()`, `getPersonality()` — loads `.mvdm` DM personality files from `personalities/` (bundled, strict) and `~/.machine-violet/personalities/` (user, lenient) |
| `seeds.ts` | `SEEDS`, `seedsForGenre()` — campaign premise seeds by genre |
| `first-launch.ts` | `.env` loading, config paths, API key format validation |
| `campaign-archive.ts` | `archiveCampaign()`, `unarchiveCampaign()`, `deleteCampaign()`, `listArchivedCampaigns()`, `getCampaignDeleteInfo()` — campaign archival, restoration, and deletion with verification |
| `main-menu.ts` | Campaign listing and selection |
| `tokens.ts` | `TOKEN_LIMITS` — model token capacity constants |
| `machine-settings.ts` | Machine-scoped settings persistence (`machine-settings.json`) — feature flags like `devModeEnabled` |

## Shared: types/ — Type Definitions

Shared TypeScript interfaces. No implementations. All re-exported from `index.ts`.

| File | Key types |
|---|---|

| `entities.ts` | `EntityFrontMatter` |
| `tui.ts` | `NarrativeLine`, `FormattingNode`, modal types |
| `compendium.ts` | `Compendium`, `CompendiumEntry`, `CompendiumCategory` |

## Engine: content/ — Content Pipeline

PDF ingestion and content processing. **Completely separate from the rest of the game engine** — the only shared interface is the filesystem format. If you delete this module, the game still runs.

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `pdf-extract.ts` | Local PDF text extraction via pdf-parse (no AI, no API calls) |
| `pdf-split.ts` | PDF splitting (pdf-lib) and validation (`getPdfInfo()`) |
| `batch-client.ts` | Anthropic Batch API helpers (polling, result collection) — for future processing pipeline |
| `job-manager.ts` | Ingest job CRUD, collection manifests, status tracking |
| `cache-writer.ts` | Write extracted pages to per-page .md cache files |
| `ingest.ts` | Top-level orchestrator: validate → extract → cache → report |
| `types.ts` | Interfaces for jobs, chunks, extraction results |

## Client: phases/ — App Lifecycle

State machine for the application: main menu → playing (setup or gameplay) / add content → returning_to_menu → main menu (loop). The main menu also branches into settings and its sub-phases (api_keys, discord_settings, archived_campaigns). On first launch, config.json is auto-created with defaults. Setup runs as a pseudo-campaign session inside PlayingPhase (SetupPhase was removed in #311).

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `MainMenuPhase.tsx` | Themed campaign selection screen with New Campaign, Continue (with Archive/Delete columns), Add Content (Dev Mode only), Quit |
| `ArchivedCampaignsPhase.tsx` | List archived campaign zips with dates, select to unarchive |
| `AddContentPhase.tsx` | PDF import flow: name collection → drop files → validate → extract → cache |
| `PlayingPhase.tsx` | Main game loop — handles both gameplay and setup (setup runs as a pseudo-campaign session) |
| `SettingsPhase.tsx` | Full-screen out-of-game Settings menu (title: "Settings"). Five items: API Keys (→ ConnectionsPhase), Discord (→ DiscordSettingsPhase), Archived Campaigns (→ ArchivedCampaignsPhase), Enable Dev Mode (ON/OFF toggle, persists via `setMachineSettings` to `machine-settings.json`), Show Debug Info (ON/OFF toggle for verbose narrative lines, session-scoped) |
| `ConnectionsPhase.tsx` | Full-screen AI provider management wizard (title: "AI Connections"). Sub-screens: Connections list (health indicators, per-connection usage segments, R = recheck / D = delete), Model Assignments (large/medium/small tier picker), Add Connection wizard (provider → API key → label → optional base URL), Sign in with ChatGPT (OAuth via codex app-server) |
| `DiscordSettingsPhase.tsx` | Full-screen Discord Rich Presence Enable/Disable toggle (title: "Discord"). Saves the choice to `discord-settings.json`; ESC returns without saving |

## Engine: prompts/ — Prompt Templates

Markdown files loaded at runtime via `loadPrompt(name, modelId?)` (sync, cached, CRLF→LF normalized). Template interpolation via `loadTemplate(name, vars, modelId?)` with `{{placeholder}}` syntax.

Key prompts: `dm-identity.md` (identity preamble) and `dm-directives.md` (directives, voice, craft, formatting, tools — emitted after the personality so persona-specific register claims the seat before the generic rules), plus one `.md` per subagent (named to match).

### Model-family conditional inclusion

Any prompt `.md` can include sections gated on the active model ID:

```markdown
<!--if:gpt-->
Tighten the rule against "not X, but Y" sentence construction.
<!--else-->
(empty — Claude-family models don't need this nudge.)
<!--endif-->
```

- Matching is literal `startsWith` on the model ID. `<!--if:gpt-->` fires for `gpt-5`, `gpt-5.5`, `gpt-4o`; `<!--if:claude-opus-->` fires only for opus variants.
- The `<!--else-->` clause is optional. With no match and no else, the block expands to empty.
- No nesting — the first `<!--endif-->` closes the block.
- The preprocessor runs **before** comment stripping (`stripComments`), so conditional markers are consumed before HTML-comment stripping sees them.
- Callers must thread `modelId` through to `loadPrompt`/`loadTemplate` to activate conditionals; an omitted `modelId` causes every `<!--if:-->` to resolve to its else branch (preserving pre-feature behavior).
- The cache is keyed by `(name, modelId)`, so swapping models in-process produces independent cache entries.

Cache reset: tests must call `resetPromptCache()` in `beforeEach`.

### Includes and cascading entity override

Reusable prompt fragments live in `packages/engine/src/prompts/include/` and are pulled in by directive:

```markdown
<!--include:NPCS-->
<!--include:NPCS.Military-->
```

- The file is `include/<TagName>.md` — the directive's prefix is the file stem.
- The directive expands inline to `<TagName>...</TagName>`. The outer tag is **always** the file stem, never the variant name — `NPCS.Military` produces `<NPCS>`, not `<Military>` or `<NPCS.Military>`. The dot picks a variant of the same logical entity.
- Dotless includes look for a section named the same as the file stem (`<NPCS>` inside `NPCS.md`) as the conventional default. A file with no top-level XML sections is treated as one implicit default section.
- Pipeline order: model conditionals → process includes → strip comments. Includes are HTML-comment-shaped, so they have to be expanded before comment stripping, but after conditionals (so a conditional can gate whether an include happens).

When the same top-level `<TAG>` block appears in more than one override slot, the latest slot wins and earlier occurrences are stripped entirely. `buildDMPrefix` passes **five slots**, lowest → highest priority: `dm-identity` → `dm-directives` → `campaign_detail` → DM-personality `prompt_fragment` → DM-personality `detail` (three conceptual sources — main DM, campaign seed, DM personality — but five distinct slots, and precedence is slot-by-slot). The `campaign_detail` slot holds the seed's assembled detail followed by any setup-agent-appended detail, so a colliding tag the agent appended overrides the seed's — by design. This also lets a personality template redefine the `<NPCS>` block established by the main prompt without editing the main file. Implemented by `applyLayeredOverrides` in `process-includes.ts`, invoked from `buildDMPrefix`.

Inline `<TAG>...</TAG>` blocks (written literally in a prompt, no include directive) participate in the override too — they're the same kind of entity. Indented or inline-style XML like the narration formatters (`<b>`, `<color=...>`, `<center>`) is never matched because top-level requires the open tag at column 0.

## Client: commands/ — Slash Commands

Player commands during gameplay. `trySlashCommand()` parses and dispatches.

## systems/ — Game System Templates

Content assets at the repo root (not in `src/`). Each system gets a subdirectory copied to campaign state at init.

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `<system-id>/metadata.json` | System identity, license, complexity, dice requirements |
| `<system-id>/rule-card.md` | XML-directive format core mechanics reference, hand-authored by Opus |

Currently bundled: `24xx`, `breathless`, `cairn`, `charge`, `dnd-5e`, `fate-accelerated`, `ironsworn`.

## Engine: utils/ — Utilities

Platform abstractions and helpers that don't belong to any single domain.

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `archive.ts` | `zipFiles()`, `unzipFiles()` — zip/unzip via `fflate` (pure JS, zero deps). `ArchiveIO` interface, `setArchiveIO()` for test mocking |
| `clipboard.ts` | `ClipboardIO` interface, `copyToClipboard()`, `readFromClipboard()` — cross-platform clipboard via `clipboardy`, lazy-loaded. `setClipboardIO()` for test mocking |
| `paths.ts` | Runtime asset path resolution (prompts, themes, systems relative to executable) |

## Client: services/ — Side Integrations

| Directory | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `services/discord/` | Discord rich-presence IPC client + controller. Per-frontend opt-in (see `discord-settings.json`); engine emits `discord:presence` events and the client forwards them to local Discord IPC when enabled. |

## Test Harness Package (`packages/test-harness/`)

The **Tier-3 live** harness (the regression backbone is Tier-2 golden replay — see below). Boots the real engine as a subprocess, drives it over the WebSocket, asserts against observable state (no timer-based waits). Also hosts the interactive driver (`mvplay`) and the full-stack tape recorder.

| Path | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `bin/smoketest.ts` | Live smoke probe — walk setup + two in-game turns. `npm run smoketest`. |
| `bin/boot-and-quit.ts` | Precondition probe — main menu renders. `npm run e2e:boot`. |
| `bin/mvplay.ts` | Interactive turn-for-turn driver + tape recorder (`record`/`save-tape`). `npm run play`. |
| `src/session-driver.ts` | `mvplay` backend — persistent detached session, record-mode start, `saveTape` (pulls `GET /tape`). |
| `src/run-probe.ts` | `runProbe(opts)` helper — launches harness, runs body, dumps diagnostics on failure, cleans up. |
| `src/harness.ts` | `Harness` class — process lifecycle, WS connect, `waitFor*`, input helpers, `endSession`, `fetchTape`. |
| `src/engine-log.ts` | Engine-log breadcrumb reader (`image_gen:*`, `subagent:*`, `api:call`, ...). |
| `src/client-state.ts` | Mirror of client-side state for assertion. |

The **Tier-2 record/replay** code lives in `engine`, not here: `packages/engine/src/providers/{tape,tape-provider,tape-mode}.ts` (format + record/replay shims + record wiring), `packages/engine/src/server/routes/dev.ts` (`GET /tape` readback), and the corpora at `packages/engine/src/testing/{corpus,setup-corpus}.golden.test.ts` (DM loop + setup agent; shared `goldens/`).

See [e2e-harness.md](e2e-harness.md) (three-tier strategy, live harness), [golden-tapes.md](golden-tapes.md) (record/replay model), and [tape-format.md](tape-format.md) (tape schema).

## Client Entry Points

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `packages/client-ink/src/app.tsx` | Root Ink component — phase state machine, FileIO/GitIO setup, cost tracking. |
| `packages/client-ink/src/index.tsx` | Entry point — Ink render, raw mode guards. |
| `packages/client-ink/src/start-client.ts` | Bootstrap helper: REST/WS client init, server lifecycle. |
